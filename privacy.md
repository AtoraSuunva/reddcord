# Reddcord Privacy Policy

Last Updated & Effective as of: April 1, 2024

For Discord Bot: Mettaton EX#6447 (353356793268666370), referred to as "The Bot"

---

The Bot stores the following data, for the following reasons:

- Associated with your Discord ID:
  - Post title, content, and images that you provide to `/post`.
  - Votes you give, receive on your posts, or spend on items in the shop.
  - Which items you have purchased and used.

Interactions and options provided are logged for debugging purposes.

[Sentry](https://sentry.io) is used for error tracking. Data collected when an error occurs:

- `error`: The error message and stack trace
- `interaction`: The interaction + options used (ex. `/search [site<string>: example.com] [tags<string>: foo bar]`)
- `module`: The module that errored
- Local stack variables

Errors reported to Sentry are deleted after 90 days.

Config data for a guild is stored for 10 days after The Bot is removed from a guild, unless the bot is re-invited.

Data deleted manually or automatically (after 10 days of not being in the guild) is deleted permanently.

For a copy of your data, or to delete the data by request, you may contact the developer. Please note that you may be required to verify your identity and/or your permissions on a server before requests can be completed, to avoid unauthorized access or deletion of data.

[Discord's Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy) also applies while using Discord
